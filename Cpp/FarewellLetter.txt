Hello {Name of Manager},

With a heavy heart, I must convey to you my goodbye. It was a difficult decision to make, but I had to do it nonetheless.

I believe it is time for me to seek new ventures and opportunities.

I would take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude towards you.

You had been a great mentor, guide, and friend to me.

I learned a lot from you. I learned to balance my work and family, undertake challenging projects that I didn’t feel confident about at first, and meet deadlines despite being under pressure.

I will carry all that I learned here to my next adventure and look back at my time in this office fondly.

I hope we will keep in touch even after I leave the company.

Please don’t hesitate to reach out to me whenever you want. My email address is {Email Address}.

Subject: Farewell | Last but not the least.
Hello All,

Finally its time to say Good Bye!!

Good Byes are not easy, but sometimes they are inevitable.

[Company name or Project name] will always hold a special place in my heart as it is from where my career journey kicked off.

I entered in the firm as a graduate hire but will be leaving it with so much of learning and experience. I had the good fortune of being associated with such a helpful and encouraging team. This account is a vast ocean of knowledge and I am glad I was able to gain so much from it.

Let me make it easier than saying Good bye; Let me tell you Hello in advance for the next time I get to see you :)
