Testing:
Hi All,
I'm Radheshyam.
I've three years of experience in white box tesing/ Unit and Integration Testing.
Currently I'm working in Eximius Design as Software Engineer.
I've done Aeronautical Engineering.


There are two types of White box testing:
1. Mutation Testing -> We will insert the bug try to catch it by writing test cases.
2. Coverage based Testing -> Path, Condtion, Branch/Decision, MC/DC, Statement

cyclomatic matrix
Draw the control flow diagram
Count the bounded areas and add + 1 will give cyclomatic complexity
EX:
McCabe's Matric
E-N+2-> Formula
#include <stdio.h>
int a=10;
int b=20;
int main()
{
  while(a>b){
    c = a*b;
    b = a-1;
  }
  print(b,c);
}
Control Flow graph
|--------------|-------------
|			 Node1			|
|			   |			|
|			 Node2			|
|			   |			|
|            Node3			|
|______________|		  Node4

E -> Number of edges
N- > Number of node
E = 4
N = 4
E-N+2 = 4-4+2 = 2
The Cyclomatic complexity is 2 for this control flow
or number of Closed region + 1
In this graph there is only one closed region
Hence
1+1 = 2
There will be two test cases in this program.
or
Count how many if, else if, while and for are there and add 1.

White Box Testing is also called Structural Testing
