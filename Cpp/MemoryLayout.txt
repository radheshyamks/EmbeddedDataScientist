Memory layout:
1. Command-line arguments and Environment variables
2. Stack -> It grows from higher to lower compile time
3. Heap -> It grows from lower to higher run time
4. Bss -> It stores Uninitialized global variables and static variable
5. data -> It stores Initialized global and static variables(read-only, read-write)
6. Text -> It contains Executable file and instructions

Bss -> block started by symbol
It has two section
1. Initialized section
2. Uninitialized section
Storage class
Auto ->
Register
Static
Extern
typedef
Auto:
Auto variables get stored in stack section
Life-time of this type of variables is within the block
Visibility is aslo within the block
Accessibility is aslo within the block

Register:
This type of variable get stored in CPU registers
For this type of variables execution is very fast
